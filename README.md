# 🏥 Breast Cancer Classification with XGBoost  
This project demonstrates how to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the **XGBoost** classifier. The tutorial walks through data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and interpretation of results with a focus on teaching the principles behind gradient boosting and classification performance analysis.

## 📂 **Dataset Overview**  
**Dataset:** Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)  
- **Samples:** 569 (357 benign, 212 malignant)  
- **Features:** 30 numeric features representing cell nucleus properties, such as:  
  - Mean Radius  
  - Mean Perimeter  
  - Mean Texture  
  - Worst Concavity  
- **Target Classes:**  
  - 0 → Malignant (212 cases)  
  - 1 → Benign (357 cases)

## 🏗️ **Model: XGBoost Classifier**  
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful ensemble method based on decision trees. It builds a sequence of trees where each new tree focuses on correcting the mistakes of the previous one, using gradient-based optimization.

### **Why XGBoost?**  
✅ Fast training using parallel processing  
✅ Handles missing data automatically  
✅ Includes regularization to avoid overfitting  
✅ Captures non-linear relationships effectively  

### **Hyperparameters Used**  
| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `n_estimators` | 100 | Number of trees |
| `max_depth` | 3 | Maximum depth of each tree |
| `learning_rate` | 0.1 | Step size for boosting |
| `eval_metric` | logloss | Metric to optimize |

## 🚀 **Performance Metrics**  
The model was evaluated using key classification metrics:  

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Accuracy** | 0.95 (95%) |
| **Precision** | 0.95 |
| **Recall** | 0.94 |
| **F1-Score** | 0.94 |
| **ROC AUC** | 0.992 |

✅ **High ROC AUC Score** → Near-perfect separation between malignant and benign cases.
